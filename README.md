# Threadline - A Social Network for Tailors and Fabric Vendors

- **Follow and Engage**: Users can follow their favorite tailors and vendors, like posts, and leave comments.
- **Post Designs**: Tailors can upload and share their creations, and fabric vendors can showcase new fabric or designs.
- **Messaging**: Connect with other users via direct messaging to discuss collaborations or business opportunities.
- **Marketplace**: Coming soon! A platform for buying and selling fabrics, tools, and designs directly on Threadline.
